This package is a front-end web application. It uses http://omdbapi.com/ to search for movie and television content by name or content type and returns the relevant movies with information about release year, their posters, and their IMDb page link.

## Set up

To access the app. Install npm at this link (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), if you do not already have it installed.

Then clone this repo locally, and from the root run:

```npm install```

and:

```npm start```.

This will run the app locally at http://localhost:3333/.
